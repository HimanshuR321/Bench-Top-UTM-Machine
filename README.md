# Bench Top UTM Machine

## Overview
This repository contains the Arduino code, Python code for graph plotting, and a PowerPoint presentation of the Bench Top UTM Machine project. 
A steel fabricated model of Universal Testing Machine specifically for the tensile testing of metallic wires with 2kN of Load cell.  Used with a high torque worm-gear DC motor, 2 lead screws and a innovative idea of using modified Rack & Pinion method for increasing the range of dial gauge. Finally, utilized Pythonâ€™s Serial library for reading serial monitor of Arduino IDE and Matplotlib library for plotting graphs.
